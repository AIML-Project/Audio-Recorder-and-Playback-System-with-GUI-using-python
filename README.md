# Audio-Recorder-and-Playback-System-with-GUI-using-python
This project presents the development of a voice recording and playback system using Python, integrating a voice recorder with a simple music player. The voice recorder application, developed using Tkinter for the GUI and PyAudio for capturing audio, allows users to record and save voice clips in WAV format. The system features a graphical interface with start and stop recording options, along with a timer display, and dynamically saves recordings with unique filenames to prevent overwriting.
In addition to the recording functionality, a UDP server is implemented to allow remote control of the recording process via UDP messages. This setup enables the music player, also developed with Tkinter and using the Pygame library for audio playback, to start and stop recordings remotely. The music player scans a specified directory for the latest recorded WAV file, plays it, and sends UDP messages to control the recording state.
The project demonstrates an effective integration of audio processing and remote control mechanisms, showcasing how Python's extensive libraries can be leveraged to build user-friendly multimedia applications. The application could be extended for various use cases such as remote interviews, surveillance systems, or educational tools, where synchronized audio recording and playback are required.
